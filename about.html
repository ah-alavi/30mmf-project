            <p>“Lost in Interactive Media” was created as part of our Communications Lab class. In just 30 minutes, the three of us planned, filmed, and brought this story to life.</p>
            <p>The video follows a student racing to class, only to be pulled off course by the world of interactive media around her. Every shot was chosen to build tension and keep the story engaging, from quick hallway sequences to moments of distraction that mirror the chaos of our digital lives.</p>
            <p>Filming this project was fun and fast-paced, giving us the chance to experiment with angles, timing, and playful interactions. We wanted to create something that felt immersive, dynamic, and a little overwhelming—just like the world of notifications, screens, and distractions we live in every day.</p>
            <p>Credits:</p>
            <p>Videomakers: Areeba Alavi, Anika Tahsin, Jihee Kang</p>
            <p>Professor: Jack B. Du</p>
            <p>Class: IM-UH 1011 Communications Lab</p>
